     <p class="themestext2"> Sottovoce </p>
      <p class="themestext4"> 
        Sottovoce is an independent magazine that gives voice to  whispered stories which often remain in the shadow of the daily bustle. 
        In eleven issues, through eleven themes,  the magazine discovers, tells, but first of all listens to the city and its people. 
        The 0 issue was created around the people of Rimini, a seaside city in  Italy.</p>

    <p class="themestext5"> 
      The narrative thread of this issue unfolds on the theme of desire. Desire meant as the will to create and receive aggregation. In Rimini everyone is welcomed and welcome in turn.
     Everyone’s  intimate desire is to let everyone feel they have a place in the network  of social relations. As if everyone preferred the beauty of giving space rather than the rust of taking space.
      This welcoming spirit emerges from two interviews and four articles. The first ones, with a familiar tone, investigate the stories of people who have found a quiet and a warm place place in the city,
       where to feel home. The second ones, return stories of different realities that have helped to create a point of aggregation, a social terrain, a geographical mantle to listen to diversity.

      </div>
      <p class="themestext15">Every year in the world we produce 396 million tons of plastic and each person 
        reaches about 73 kilos a year. Unfortunately, a large part of these ends up dispersed in the 
        oceans, causing serious damage to marine flora and fauna and ending up in our food diet. 
        According to a wwf study we eat a credit card a week. To overcome this great problem,
        we asked ourselves what daily habits we could change. We started from our Polytechnic community
        and decided to stem the use of disposable packaging in our lunch breaks thanks to the use 
        of the legendary Schiscia, which in Milanese dialect represents lunch at home in the container. </p>

      <p class="themestext16"> The project consists of a service where students / workers will be able to pick
        their food in the various restaurants participating  in the initiative, 
        equipped with their schiscia. Restaurateurs will say
        goodbye to disposable plastic packaging used for knives, forks, bags 
        and also thanks to discounts and promotions, they will have 
        a greater number of customers. All of this in order to safeguard 
        our oceans and make people more sensitive to this great problem.

        <p class="themestext17"> We have also designed a Schiscia Case. We understand how often the schiscia 
          can be a cause of embarrassment or discomfort and so we provide an element  that combines 
           functionality and aesthetics. It is: omfortably transportable, 
            it has a dedicated space  for cutlery and napkin and finally, 
            it’s made of Econyl, a type of regenerated nylon made by residues of fishing nets.

      <p class="themestext21"> In Lisbon there is a historical shipping company with ancient boats called Marinha do Tejo. Its values are care, excitement, heritage and community.  
        The project consists in the re-branding of the company. The aim is to enlarge the target
        with a touch of freshness end energy, especially reaching families and children. 
       </p>
        <img src="IMG/38.jpf"class="img38">
        <p class="themestext22"> In order to do so we did a new logo and visual elements, 
          So we started to ask ourselves " which are the main recognasiable elements of Marinha? 
         And for sure we picked up the river, if u go to Facebook you will find tons of pics of the river. 
          Then the colours because they are so different from the black and white of all the other boats
          And last but not least the boat, which are the basis of all the brand. 
          
          From the boats we started to think  visually about the logo and we started to sketch and trace the sails in order to explore all the possible shapes.
          From those we draw the logo which return the boat shaopes  but then we also played with the typography so we thought about the m of the Velas
          The d which remind  s our of the dock, and the t of the river. </p>

         Here, never watched it again! In the last year, artistic world has profoundly changed its face, 
          giving us a free amount of material on the web but moving us away from a more heartfelt 
          and participatory relationship between users and creators. From this problem pArte was born. 
        A service that reinvents the relationship between audience and artist through

            The artist can be a simple viewer, seeing all the projects created. Or he can cocreate 
            actively with the artist choosing the category he likes the most. The artist must upload 
            the brief with the instructions and the details of the whole project. In addition, 
            one random function was made, in order to give people the possibility

        <p class="themestext31"> Page Rank</p>
      </div>
      <p class="themestext32"> Can an algorithm predict the most important pages of the web? 
        Google’s Page Rank can, and so can you! Page Rank estimates the probability 
        of a web page to be visited by a user. It makes an evaluation of the most 
        relevant pages based on their links with the other pages. A “Random Walker” 
        is also considered in the process: hypothetical “drunk” users of the web 
        randomly moving between the pages, always ending up on the best linked ones.
    </p>
    <img src="IMG/68.png"class="img68">
    <img src="IMG/59.png"class="img59">
   

  
  <p class="themestext33">
    We used a page rank simulator to actually calculate the ranking of the most important pages 
    based on the network of links connected to them. From this simulation we have built the basic 
    structure of the poster on which the people themselves will play, attaching stickers of random walkers. 
  </p>
  <img src="IMG/63.png"class="img63">
  <img src="IMG/65.jpg"class="img65">
  <p class="themestext34">
   “Random Walkers” are in fact considered in the process: hypothetical “drunk” users of the web randomly moving
between the pages, always ending up on the best linked ones. We have tried to explain the process behind
the algorithm asking people to be our “random walkers”. They took some stickers
and stick them in each white platform in the first poster layer, creating their own path.
  </p>
  <img src="IMG/64.jpg"class="img64">
  <img src="IMG/61.png"class="img61">
  <p class="themestext35">
  The structure of the poster has been divided into two layers, the last of which on transparency. 
  This is because we wanted the similarity between what was above and what was below to be easily visible. 
  Indeed, Once people finished to attach the stickers, the final result were shown. In the
  second layer it was already predicted what was underneath. So the platform with more stickers 
  were resulting the same. That’s because even if people choose were to go, the path is already set by the link stracture.

        <p class="themestext38">The social media landscape is much broader than one might imagine.
           Behind the big giants, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Tiktok there are hundreds of social media
            that like to declare themselves as alternatives. All the research is based on keywords and expressions and it aims to study these alternatives, 
            providing a list of social media from which emerge the great issues and themes of the 2022 digital landscape.</p>

      <p class="themestext39"> Words are the core of the whole research. Keywords and expressions were extracted 
      in order to deeply understand the world of alternative social media. They have different shades, sometimes are used to say something and sometimes its contrary. 
      For this kind of job, it was fundamental that we worked collectively as a group. Since this research is qualitative, 
      we needed to have multiple perspectives on the texts that we analysed. 
       </p>
       <img src="IMG/72.jpg"class="img72">
       <img src="IMG/70.jpg"class="img70">
     <p class="themestext40"> We defined three different protocols to approach the subject. In the first one, we decided to focus on self 
      descriptions of social media, how alternative social media auto describe theirselves?
      In the second protocol we looked at the other side of the coin. What do users think about these alternative social media? 
     In order to do so, we analysed their reviews. Finally, we investigated the possible relation between alternative 
     social media and their year of birth.</p>

     <img src="IMG/69.jpg"class="img69">
     <p class="themestext41"> The research book was structured in order to let the reader choose where to start disocvering the three different protocols. 
       After the whole research we build with code an online website focusing on the first protocol, 
      the auto description of alternative social media. We divided it in three main pages: 
      1) the catalogue, 2) the ecosystem and 3) the themes.</p>
      
     <img src="IMG/78.jpg"class="img78">
     <img src="IMG/77.jpg"class="img77">
     <p class="themestext43"> The catalogue provides a list of 87 alternative socail media in alphabetical order. For each social media the main keywords that characterize its payoff are highlighted , 
     as well as the entire payoff by the passage of the mouse. Also content can be filtered based on the themes at the bottom of the page. 
     In addition to this, there’s always the chance to reach the website of each social media to discover more.</p>
     <img src="IMG/76.jpg"class="img76">
     <img src="IMG/79.jpg"class="img79">
     <p class="themestext44"> 
      The ecosystem is valuable in order to get a broader view of the digital panorama. Here you can discover relationships and connections between 
      themes and social media involved. You may notice that some dots (so themes) are bigger (and therefore more recurrent) than others. 
      Some social media instead do not have in their payoff keywords linked to any to the themes selected. </p>

      In the ‘themes’ section we can find all the themes explained, and it is interesting that each description of the themes 
      has been created using the expressions used by social themeselves. Under the description there’s a wall of words
       which is full of all the expressions used by social media to refer to that theme, their order and repetition is 
       based on the recurrence of usage in social media payoffs. </p>

      <p class="themestext48"> I have never been to Singapore but at IADE creative University I found out that if I took a nice evening walk my eyes would not experience any kind of nocturnal adaptation because the artificial twilight is so bright that it simulates the day. 
        Every year 3 billion of energy is dispersed in the sky. This means that around 600 million trees would need to be planted to offset that number. 
        Light pollution is an ever-expanding problem but there are things that can be done to reduce it, just think that 35% of it comes from poor direction of outdoor lights or that in America most people sleep with the lights on for an average of 3 nights a week. Everybody in Italy likes to make wishes on August 10th, let's make a commitment to keep doing it!<p>
          <img src="IMG/luminoso.gif"class="img82">
          <p class="themestext49">
            First of all, I started to collect data and after having discovered the ten most polluted cities I analyzed their level of pollution over the years 
            thanks to the Light Pollution Map database. It was very interesting to see the changes but also worrying to know that every year every city is constantly growing in terms of light pollution.</p>
            <img src="IMG/83.jpg"class="img83">
            <p class="themestext50"> This data visualisation posters aim to make people aware about this huge problem which is usually underestimated.
The background of each poster contains a gradient with white texture which resemble the stars that represents two main data: 
The first one, is that only the 20% percentage of people still see the Milky Way.
The second one, is that the 35% percentage of the world light emissions are a big waste mostly because they are poorly aimed or because they are always switch on when its not needed.</p>
<img src="IMG/84.jpf"class="img84">
<p class="themestext51"> This graph represents the level of artificial light emitted in therms of radiance by the most polluted countries from 2012 to 2021. Each segment of the semicircle it’s a country and every smaller cermicircle represents the year.  With a general overview we can see that all the countries compared to 2012 have seen a growth in terms of light emissions. 
  </p> 
  <img src="IMG/85.jpf"class="img85">
  <p class="themestext52"> In the one above are represented the most and least polluted countries with their related levels of pollution. </p> 
    </div>
    <img src="IMG/86.jpf"class="img86">
    <p class="themestext53">The second visualisation graphically reminds of one of the most famous constellations Cassiopeia, and it always talks about waste of light. According to a study conducted in Canada in fact, street lights are the cause of only the 20% of light pollution in our city, 
      the ramaingn 80% comes from the wast of light in our residencial building, in our homes. A study showed how much in America people sleep with at least one light on for an everage of three times a week. 
       The dots represent the number of flatmates and the yellow fill colour of the constellation indicates the average of days sleeping with lights on. We can sadly see that even those who live alone sleeps almost 3 nights per week with one light on.

      </div>
      <p class="themestext56"> “It’s all about killing time as well as earning some pennies”.
        These are the words of an average Turker whose name we are not allowed to know. In the hybrid mix of artificial and
        and human, there are invisible workers ready to perform
        small tasks online. The Economist called them ‘on tap’
        workers, all those belonging to the mass of independent
        and available-on-demand labour force on Amazon Turk :
        a crowdsourcing internet service that allows computer
        programmers to coordinate the use of human intelligence
        to perform tasks that computers, on their own, can’t do.
        Many of them stay glued to their chairs for hours, selling
        their time for a non-existent paycheck, fascinated by the
        ease and speed of the tasks to be performed, also known
        as HIT (human intelligence tasks).
        From the datasets reported here, I want to indicate the main reasons why so many workers rely on Amazon’s service, the time spent on the platform and the pay received, which in most cases never reaches the minimum wage and stops
        at 2 euros per hour.<p>
          <img src="IMG/giffrasi.gif"class="giffrasi">
          <p class="themestext57"> First I collected some testimonies (some above) of the reasons for which they took part in mechanical turk. 
          After finding a study regarding their salaries and the demographics of these online workers, I thought about visualization.</p>
          <img src="IMG/88.jpg"class="img88">
          <p class="themestext57">To better explain the problem, I decided to use the Shanghai metaphor. 
          This is because they were invented in China to kill time and because they consist of one of the simplest and most 
          entertaining examples of games, just like Mechanical Turk in the eyes of turkers sitting on their desks with quick tasks just a click away. Furthermore, their graphic and repetitive essentiality suited the direct communication
of the selected data.</p>
<img src="IMG/89.png"class="img89">
<p class="themestext58"> During the exhibition at Politecnico di Milano with the Density Design lab there was also a table where the Shanghai game itself and a QR  present to be scanned. After having scanned, you come to a webpage where users will have to press start, start playing Shanghai and once after having wanted to end the game, click on stop. At the end, according to the playing time, the pay received for the time used for the HIT performed ( that is the game of the Shangai)
will be released.</p>

            those who want to see them“
            I imagine Herni Matisse walking through
            the streets of Paris, speaking these words.
            Photography has always been my cup of
            tea and has helped me to grasp every single
            detail, shape and color that could enrich
            my gaze. It is an extraordinary art that
            pushes you to pay attention and to wait, things that I am not used to especially in our everyday digital society. 
             I both use digital and anlogue cameras but I enjoy the last ones the most. </p>
